# <u>**Week 3 Challenge**</u>
This weeks challenge focused on our newly found skills in Javascript. This required us to use our knowledge to create a password generator that operated without hitch when combined with a large amount of variables.

## <u?>**Motivation**</u>
Here is a list of my motivations for this project!

- learn how to properly use a "for loop" to truely randomize a password based on its inputs
- better grasp the use for "if" statements for result driven actions
- utlizing the console log to help me troubleshoot my coding mistakes
- lastly, I wanted to create a fully functioning password generator that myself and anyone I know can use to create strong passwords for safety
